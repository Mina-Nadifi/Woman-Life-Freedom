          How habits are formed Habits are routines or rituals that are
          unconscious or that have become almost automatic or second nature. But
          where do habits come from? Your sensory nervous system is always
          monitoring for actions you can take that will deliver a hit of
          dopamine, the brain’s reward chemical. We’re wired to seek out
          pleasure. This may be what makes habits so hard to break. They come
          from a brain region that’s out of your conscious control, so you’re
          barely aware you’re doing them, if at all.<br />
           On 21 September 2022, Iranian women started to change their old beliefs and also habits. Over the last decade, women’s organized resistance to veiling has only grown. Young women filmed or photographed themselves removing their headscarves in public. They posted videos online of women being harassed in public by morality police or other citizens for wearing “improper” hijab as a way to shame the harassers. Perhaps the killing of Mahsa Amini may prove to be the turning point in Iranian women’s long struggle for freedom. We may just be witnessing the beginning of a revolution. Woman. Life. Freedom.
